# Issue & Redeem 

Once the manager has filled the parameters required to create the fund, they will generate their own unique token that represents a share of the assets in the fund.

Anyone can then issue more Fund/Program tokens by providing the appropriate amount of assets.

Here is an example: 

Fund tokens total supply - **1000**
Fund assets allocation - **2 ETH, 100 GVT**

In order to issue another **500** Fund tokens, investors need to deposit **1 ETH and 50 GVT**. 
After the investment, Fund will have the following structure:
Fund tokens total supply - **1500**
Fund assets allocation - **3 ETH, 150 GVT**

Redeeming Fund tokens works in reverse:

The investor returns **500** Fund tokens to the smart contract and gets **1 ETH and 50 GVT** (minus the management fee, earned by the manager throughout the investment period).
