# Protocol structure overview
The upper level of the protocol is based on the GenesisFund and GenesisProgram entities.

GenesisFund and GenesisProgram are based on the **GenesisCoffer** entity, which implements the ERC-20 (or BEP-20 for BSC) interface. It allows you to:
- Issue and Redeem tokens secured by assets in GenesisCoffer
- Work with the fund as with a regular ERC-20 token
- Calculate and pay the Management Fee (annual percent)

Although **Program** and **Fund** entities look similar and serve the same purpose as an asset management tool, their approaches are different.

The **Program** is managed directly by the manager's trade transactions. 

The **Fund** is managed in a declarative manner by setting up required assets allocations. Trading operations are carried out automatically.

**GenesisCore** is a liaison contract with the Genesis Vision Protocol. Its main functions are:
- Creation of Funds and Programs
- Managing the list of supported assets
- Managing the list of available liquidity pools


## Fund or program creation:
To create a fund or program, the manager must define the following initial parameters:
- Fund/Program Name
- Token Symbol (ticker)
- Initial token supply
- Management Fee (annual percent)


## Investing in a Fund or Program
Investing in a Fund or Program can be done in two ways:
- Purchase already issued ERC-20 tokens of the Fund/Program from other investors
- Issue new tokens through the investment directly in the Fund/Program
