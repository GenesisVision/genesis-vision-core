## Managers
**Program/Fund Managers** are companies/individuals, aimed to attract investors' money for management. The profit, received as a result of the total funds management, is shared proportionally between the Managers and Investors. In addition to the profit’s share, Managers receive a commission for management (**Management Fee**).
## Investors
**Investors** do not trade on the market directly. Instead, investors transfer their funds to experienced traders who manage the funds for them through Program or Fund. Investors get proportional shares from their managers’ profits.


## Trading Platforms
These are platforms that provide access to decentralized assets and trading instruments. The most popular types of trading platforms currently are AMM (decentralized asset exchange) and DEX (decentralized transactions with different financial instruments, including leverage and derivatives trading).
