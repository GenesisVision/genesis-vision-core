# Genesis Vision Protocol Contracts Repository

[Genesis Vision Protocol](https://genesis.vision) is a smart contracts for decentralized assset management on the Ethereum and the BSC (Binance Smart Chain) blockchains.

## GenesisVisionGateway

Gateway allowing communication with centralized assets ([Funds](https://genesis.vision/invest/funds) and [Programs](https://genesis.vision/invest/programs)) of Genesis Vision assets. Investments and withdrawals are carried out through a smart contract.

## DeFi Programs andÂ Funds

DeFi Programs and Funds infrastructure is based on the "Coffer" entity. This is an abstraction, which implements ERC20 (BEP20 for BSC) protocol over the assets under management. Coffer provides functionality for investments and withdrawals via Tokens Issue or Redeem together with manager's and investors' share calculation.

Primarily, users will be interacting with Program and Fund entities. The functionality of those entities is very similar to what you've already seen in our current Genesis Vision Programs and Funds.

Program allows manager to perform trades through the smart contract, which utilizes connected decentralized liquidity. Fund is similar to Program, the difference is that instead of direct trading, it's being managed in a declarative manner by setting up required target allocations of assets.
